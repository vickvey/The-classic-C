## Overview

The fixed array implementation consists of three main files:

- `array.h`: Header file containing data structures and function declarations.
- `array.c`: Implementation file containing the functions for array operations.
- `main.c`: The main program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with the array.

## Prerequisites

Before using this program, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of C programming.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the project using your C compiler:

   ```bash
   gcc main.c array.c -o array_program
Run the compiled executable:

bash
Copy code
./array_program
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the fixed array.

Commands
View Current Elements (1): Displays the current elements in the array.

Insert Element (2): Allows you to insert an element into the array at a specified position.

Delete Element (3): Allows you to delete an element from the array at a specified position.

Sort Array (4): Sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm.

Search Element (5): Searches for an element in the array and returns its index if found.

Exit (0): Exits the program.

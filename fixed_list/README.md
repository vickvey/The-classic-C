## Overview

The fixed array implementation consists of three main files:

- `array.h`: Header file containing data structures and function declarations.
- `array.c`: Implementation file containing the functions for array operations.
- `main.c`: The main program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with the array.

## Prerequisites

Before using this program, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of C programming.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the project using your C compiler:

   ```bash
   gcc main.c array.c -o array_program
3. Run the compiled executable:
    ```bash
    ./array_program
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the fixed array.

## Commands

1. Displays the current elements in the array.

2. Allows you to insert an element into the array at a specified position.
 
3. Allows you to delete an element from the array at a specified position.
 
4. Sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm.
 
5. Searches for an element in the array and returns its index if found.

And, for exiting the program press (0).
